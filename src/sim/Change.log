	Thanks to Kristin Tennessen from UC Davis for identifying a bug in
	functions lvector() and lmatrix() in relation to malloc() function call
	-- sizeof(int *) / sizeof(int) should have been sizeof(long *) /
	sizeof(long). This bug shows up in 64-bit machine.

	Slight tidy-up of the SCHNAarP code after 10+ years it was last changed

	UC Davis for accessing the original source code since 3DNA is not
	open-source per Rutgers licensing policy.

August 1998 and before
	initial coding of the package
