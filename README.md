# Chromatin Dynamics

## General description

Chromatin Dynamics allows to obtain 3D structures of chromatin fibers at the base pair 
level considering nucleosome positions. It requires as input the sequence of linker DNA
and the position of the nucleosomes in the sequence. The conformational sampling is done
by a Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm, considering flexible linkers and rigid nucleosomes.
Linker DNA is represented at the base pair level by a pseudo-harmonic potential expressed
in helical parameters (*rise*, *slide*, *shift*, *twist*, *roll*, *tilt*). Debye-Huckel
electrostatics and excluded volume potentials are added to avoid overlaps.

## Precompiled version for Linux

Tested on different Ubuntu and Fedora terminals.<br/>
No installation required (see below for compiling/installing from source files).

Execution:

> ``sh run.sh [nucleosome positions] [linker sequence] [# of MC iterations] [output folder]``

- Nucleosome positions file example: nucl_pos.dat
- Linker DNA sequence file example: link_seq.dat
- The output folder should not exist and an absolute path should be given.

The expected time of execution is approximately 10 seconds per MC iteration on a standard
desktop computer.

Example:

> ``sh run.sh nucl_pos.dat link_seq.dat 100 ~/chrom_dyn/test``

*Outputs generted inside the output folder:*

### Source files

The ``src/`` directory contains the code for the two instances of the program: obtaining the
starting 3D structure from the linker sequence and the nucleosome positions (``ini_str/``
directory) and simulating the different fiber conformations (``sim/`` directory). The main code
is in the file ``main_tetra_di.c`` of each directory. Type ``make`` to compile the program and
execute as indicated in the ``README`` file.

The program compiles in less than a minute on a standard desktop computer.
